# Weekly Report Generation Rules

## Critical Rules

- Reports must be based on the Git history and include only current user's activity
- Reports must be organized by days, with dates in the format "Day, Month Date" (e.g., "Monday, June 2")
- Each day's activities must be summarized in a single line, combining multiple related tasks with commas and using "and" for the last item
- Use ticket/issue numbers in parentheses when available (e.g., "#123")
- Separate distinct types of work with commas and use "and" for the final item
- Include both development work and infrastructure/DevOps tasks in the summary
- Use past tense for all activities
- Maintain chronological order, starting from the earliest date
- Exclude merge commits unless they represent significant integration work
- Focus on actual changes and features rather than listing every commit
- Group related changes even if they were committed separately
