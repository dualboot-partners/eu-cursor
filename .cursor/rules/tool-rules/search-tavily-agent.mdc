description: This rule governs the process of searching for information using the MCP Tavily tools. It should be applied whenever: (1) The user requests information that may be time-sensitive, (2) The user asks questions about current events or recent developments, (3) The user needs up-to-date information that might be beyond the AI training data, or (4) The user explicitly requests a web search. This rule ensures accurate time-awareness when performing searches and helps provide the most current information possible. It is particularly important for queries related to current events, recent product releases, price information, or other time-sensitive data.

# Web Search with Time Awareness

## Critical Rules

- Always run the local `date` command before performing any search to determine the current date and time
- Include the current date in your analysis when interpreting search results
- For time-sensitive queries, explicitly mention the current date when presenting search results
- When using MCP Tavily search tools, consider setting appropriate time range parameters based on the query
- For news-related searches, use the "news" topic and recent time range when appropriate
- When in doubt about whether information might be outdated, perform a search rather than relying on training data
- If search results conflict with your training data, prioritize the more recent information from search results
- Use MCP_TAV2_tavily_extract for detailed content analysis when simple search results are insufficient
- For complex research tasks, consider multiple targeted searches rather than a single broad query
- When using date-based parameters in search, format dates according to the user's locale if specified

## Examples

<example>
# User asks about a current event

# First, I'll check the current date to ensure time-awareness
$ date
Tue May 14 10:30:45 UTC 2025

# Now I can perform a search with the current date in mind
mcp_TAV2_tavily_search(query="latest news about Twitter acquisition", topic="news", time_range="week")

# Based on the search results, I can provide up-to-date information while noting the current date
According to the most recent information as of May 14, 2025, [summary of findings about Twitter acquisition...]
</example>

# User asks about a current event

# Providing information without checking the current date
The Twitter acquisition is still in progress according to my training data.

# Not using appropriate search tools for time-sensitive information

# Not mentioning when information might be outdated
