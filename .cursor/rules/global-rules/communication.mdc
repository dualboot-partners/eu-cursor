# Common communication approach

## Critical Rules

  - in the answer use the same language you were asked, exception is only code.
  - answer short unless you asked to explain something
  - use a directory /ai to store and read usefull and important information about the project. Don't store small details.
  - start with writing a few reasoning paragraphs, consider different options and approaches. Don't jump to fast conclusions.
